## Terminology

- **Scope** — The area of life you're focusing on (e.g., Work, Misc). Scopes help you track how much time you spend on different aspects of your day.
- **Goal** — The specific objective for your current session (e.g., "Finish report", "Clear inbox"). Goals keep you focused during a single Pomodoro.
